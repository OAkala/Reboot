This is a platform meant to mimic the functions of a service-based organization.

##  Project Modules:

1. [Easy Form](#id-section1)
<div id='id-section1'/>

### Easy Form
 This is the first module in creating an app that mirrors the functions performed in a chosen company. This module of the project focuses on handling the forms filled out by end users in the company. In this Rotary-Form project we would be converting a form into a questionnaire that would automatically populate the official pdf report.
 Below is a picture of the form we would be working with
